    <h2> La Lumière is a small, independent jewellery business that creates hand-made
      polymer clay charms, necklaces and other items.
      The inspiration behind the brand's name lies in the French essence of simple elegance,
      as well as ‘the light’ which is created from the pleasures of creativity.
    Polymer clay is an art medium that is known for its versatility, pliability and
    simplicity to work with. It is an oven bake modelling material composed of polymers,
    resins, colouring agents and fillers.   </h2>
